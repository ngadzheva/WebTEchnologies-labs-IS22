1. Make the Delete button of every new added student functional:
    We want when the user clicks the Delete button on any student's entry, the student's entry to be removed from the table.
2. Add validation of the form fields:
    We want the user to not be able to add a new user's entry unless:
        - all the fields are populated with data
        - the faculty number of the student is valid: a number between 70000 and 79999
        - the mark of the student is valid: a number between 2 and 6
    If some of the fields are not valid, display an error message to the user.
